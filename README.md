# üíê Iris: An Analysis of the Classic Dataset

This repository features `iris.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook crafted to provide a comprehensive walkthrough of the classic Iris flower dataset. This project covers the entire data analysis workflow, from initial exploration and visualization to building a final predictive model.

It serves as a practical example for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of data science in Python.

### About the Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is a benchmark for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*). Each sample has four distinct features:
* Sepal Length (cm)
* Sepal Width (cm)
* Petal Length (cm)
* Petal Width (cm)

The goal is to accurately classify the flower species using the provided measurements.

### Key Tasks Covered

The notebook demonstrates a complete analysis by tackling several key tasks:

* **Data Loading & Inspection**: Using Pandas to load the data and get a first look at its structure.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Calculating summary statistics and identifying core properties of the data.
* **Data Visualization**: Creating histograms, box plots, and scatter plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model with Scikit-learn to classify the Iris species.
